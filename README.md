# SpanishApp

This isn't a large, sophisticated project; there are two different things in this repository:
1. A web scraper that translates a small list of words using the SpanishDict website. I run `main.py` on my phone when I read books and need a quick translator. Some of my attempts to compile it as an Android APK for personal use are still here. I do not want to share this widely, of course.
2. A big jumbled script that generates audio "trainer" files with words and their translations. It also has parts of the code I made to aggregate a large list of Spanish words from different sources and rank them by frequency. An example audio output is in here in .mp3 format, and I made several of these so that I could learn a large "chunk" of words from the big list.
