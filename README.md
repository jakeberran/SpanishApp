# SpanishApp

This is a web scraper that translates a small list of words using the SpanishDict website. I run `main.py` on my phone when I read books and need a quick translator.

I have not been able to successfully compile this as an Android APK, but some of the work in my attempts shows up here. I am obviously not going to share this widely but it is nice for small-scale, personal use.
